# Issues

A project from the book 'Programming Elixir'. The app fetches arbitrary number of issues from any repo specified and formates them
for a better overview.

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `issues` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:issues, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```
